# Getting Started
### Technologies used:
1. Java 11 is used along with Lambda expressions and Streams API.
2. Lombok is used to generate getters, setters, builder pattern for constructor creation,
 and an all args constructor for LeagueTableEntry. This happens seamlessly at compile time so not a runtime requirement.
3. Junit 5 and Assertj are used to write relevant tests for the LeagueTable logic.

## How to build:
1. All that's needed is to run `./gradlew clean build` this will download and install the required gradle version and run the tests contained.
2. To view the code an IDE or text editor like Sublime or Atom is required.
